Welcome to I T Infrastructure and Security Section 2.12 data 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.900
centers 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.790
Now here we are basically going to look at the 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.550
big big giant end of the hardware 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.270
So a data center is where most of the hardware 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.890
is stored and that's what would be looking at 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.630
So you can see here 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.460
The considerations are a little bit far away from the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.010
central focus off this course
