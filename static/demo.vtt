Welcome to I T 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.910
Infrastructure and Security Section 2.12 data centers 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.790
Now here we are basically going to look at the 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.550
big big giant end of the hardware 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.270
So a data center is where most of the hardware 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.890
is stored and that's what would be looking at 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.630
So you can see here 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.460
The considerations are a little bit far away from the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.450
central focus off this course but it's simply worth remembering 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400
some of the issues that relate to this 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.460
We don't expect any great amount of expertise in this 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.310
area but just to have some idea about the terminology 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:48.310


00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.250
Okay so we'll be looking at Ah you know the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.380
various the history which is a couple of slide the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.700
categories which is another couple slides and then delay out 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.900
pound supply cooling the energy usage the levels of availability 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.450
and finally the physical security 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.750
So it's it's very much an overview 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.130
Um one might expect people in I t 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.860
Degrees to actually gravitate towards Is this if you wanted 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.130
to be a their data centre manager either a small 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.900
one or a medium sized one These are the sort 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.220
of considerations that you would be looking at Okay So 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.720
um on top of all the technicalities off the computing 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.740
side of things you'd be looking at this sort of 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.040
stuff 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.710
It's well as a manager 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.950
So apart from the end user devices um most of
